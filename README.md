Hi, I’m @Danubidascferraz

I’m passionate about learning and currently focused on Agile Project Management, Excel, and Power BI.

I’m improving my GitHub skills and working on enhancing my LinkedIn profile to better showcase my experience and interests.

At the moment, I’m enrolled in two courses:  
**“Simplifica Excel - Do Zero ao Expert”** and **“Intentional Kanban: FULL GUIDE” by Ana G Soares**.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to people management, where I can apply my knowledge and grow through real-world experience.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn:

A fun fact about me: I love learning new languages and I’m currently studying English!
